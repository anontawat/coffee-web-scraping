# coffee-web-scraping
This is to showcase how I scraped the data from the [CQI website](https://database.coffeeinstitute.org/coffees/arabica) (**only 2021 arabica coffee data**) by using Selenium. You will need a credential in order to view the database. The resulting excel file can be downloaded in this repository as well.
